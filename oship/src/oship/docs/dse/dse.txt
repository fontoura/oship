To activate the decision support engine (dse) you must have a C compiler and you must do the following steps:

1. Go into the oship/src/oship/dse directory; rename setup.__ to setup.py and execute 'python setup.py install'

2. When this is complete you will have a build subdirectory, in that subdirectory will be a 
   platform specific subdirectory lib.xxxxx with a subdirectory named clips with a file named 
   _clips.so Copy this file into the oship/src/oship/dse/clips directory

3. Now place an empty __init__.py file in the oship/src/oship/dse directory. 
   You can simply copy it from one of the other direcoties if you wish but be sure it only 
   contains a comment or nothing at all.

4. Now rename the setup.py file in the dse directory back to setup.__

5. Back at the top level oship directory; issue the command bin/oship-debug
   you should get a normal Python prompt >>> at this prompt, type import clips if you get 
   no errors and only a new prompt then all is well.  
   
6. I suggest going through the examples in the PyCLIPS documentation (included in the oship/docs directory). 
   You can then review the files in the dse/Examples directory.
   
7. The dsedemo is an OSHIP application that demonstrates how simple decisions are made regarding childhood 
   immunizations using the normal if/then approach as well as the dse.
