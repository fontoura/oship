<p>
It is intended to demonstrate how to create applications using OSHIP based on openEHR fundamentals.<br />
This application is not robust enough to actually use for real patient information and there are no security checks.
</p>
<p>
To Use the demo:<br />
Add a few patients and then click on a patient name.  It will open a new page for their BP tracking EHR.
</p>
<p>
Note that the search function is not yet implemented nor are the archetypes ready for use.
</p>
<p>
Though the source code is fairly well commented.  There will soon be a document describing how the archetypes are created and how the demo works.

Thanks for taking the time to take a look at OSHIP.  Please feel free to contact us on the mailing list with any questions.
