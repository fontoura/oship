<h2>Introduction</h2>








<p>




This page provides access to a tool-based UML expression of the <span style="font-style: italic;">open</span>EHR Release 1.0.1 models. Two variants are available:</p>












<ul>












  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.openehr.org/uml/release-1.0.1/Browsable/indexLeft.html">Browsable</a> -&nbsp;good for online browsing and printing of single diagrams, classes etc.</p>








  </li>








  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.openehr.org/uml/release-1.0.1/Printable/Printable101.html">Printable</a> - good for printing the entire model (including diagrams), browsing in a serial fashion, and locating classes by name.</p>








  </li>












</ul>








<p>The <a href="http://www.openehr.org/uml/release-1.0.1/Browsable/Dictionary.html#">Dictionary view</a> from the browsable form provides text definitions of all classes and attributes.</p>






<p>The model is expressed in MagicDraw 9.5, and is available <a href="../../../../architecture/computable/UML/MagicDraw/openehr.xml.zip">here</a> in the standard zipped XML form used by MagicDraw. An XMI 1.0 file output from the tool is also available.</p>












<h2>Status</h2>








<h3>Summary</h3>








<p>The models shown here are are <span style="font-style: italic;">derived from</span> the official <span style="font-style: italic;">open</span>EHR Release-1.0.1 architecture. The PDF
specifications should always be treated as being correct.
The current status of the UML published here is <span style="font-weight: bold;">draft</span>. Various sources of difference from the official specifications exist:</p>








<ul>








  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>they contain some shortcomings due to using a UML 1.4 tool</p>








  </li>








  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>limitations in UML itself to correctly represent object-oriented semantics occasionally affect the models</p>








  </li>








  <li>may contain human errors</li>








</ul>








<p>Please report errors in these models with respect to the online specifications to the <span style="font-style: italic;">open</span>EHR <a href="mailto:Webmaster@openehr.org">webmaster</a>.</p>








<h3>Detail</h3>








<p>



The UML models available from this page are derived from the official online PDF documentation (available <a target="_blank" href="../../../roadmap.html">here</a>). Although the UML models here are tool-produced there are a number of <span style="font-weight: bold;">limitations of the tool</span>
(and these seem to be common with most tools on the market today) that
have affected the fidelity of the representation in various small ways:</p>








<ol>








  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>List&lt;T&gt;, Set&lt;T&gt;, Array&lt;T&gt;, Hash&lt;T,K&gt;, Interval&lt;T&gt; were all 
explicitly modelled, since they are not directly supported in 
UML.&nbsp; All uses of these "assumed types" were made though new 
Primitive types in MD such as List&lt;String&gt;, employing Binding Dependencies.</p>








  </li>








  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>Associations are shown with far-end role names and Navigation arrows.</p>








  </li>








  <li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>Constraint statements are syntactically very similar to the 
syntax used in the specifications, and nearly always pass OCL syntax checks. Differences are :
    <br>








    </p>








  </li>








</ol>








<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">








  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Class constraints use the Inv: keyword followed by an 
OCL-compliant expression
  </li>








  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Function constraints use Pre: instead of require and Post: 
instead of ensure, or Inv:
  </li>








  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Double quotes are changed to single quotes
  </li>








  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Embedded spaces inside quoted strings used as parameters are 
changed to underscore
  </li>








  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Multiple clauses inside one Constraint statement are 
supported using separate Inv: or Pre: or Post: keywords
  </li>








  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Class constraints have names, Function constraints often do not.</li>








</ul>








<p>In addition, there are imperfections in the model due to the fact that we have used version 9.5 MagicDraw, which <span style="font-weight: bold;">does not support UML 2.0</span>.
The XMI output of the current tool is at version 1.0. Version 10 of the
tool does support UML 2.0 and XMI 2, but upgrading is a non-trivial
exercise, both of the model itself (semantics of UML 2 are quite
different in some places) and of the publishing process we use to
generate the online documentation.</p>








<p>Lastly, the data entry work of putting the specifications into the tool of course carries the possibility of error.</p>








<h2>Future</h2>








<p>In the medium term, the following things will probably happen:</p>








<ul>








  <li>the models will be migrated fom MagicDraw 9.5 to MagicDraw 10</li>








  <li>the publishing scripts (currently XSLT) will be migrated to MagicDraw 10 (Python)</li>








  <li>due to this migration, an XMI 2 expression of the model will become available</li>








</ul>
