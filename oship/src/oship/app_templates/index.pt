      <td>The <strong>Open Source Health Information Platform</strong>
        (OSHIP) is a Python language implementation of the openEHR healthcare
        information model. 

        <p>OSHIP expands upon the model by providing you with a robust,
        proven, standards compliant and open source application server and
        development environment. The openEHR model provides you with the
        structure to create future proof and semantically interoperable
        healthcare applications. Everything from disease registries to
        complete electronic health record systems.<br>
        OSHIP adds on the layer that you need to rapidly become familiar with
        the openEHR model and begin building your applications today. There
        are implementations in most popular object oriented languages
        allowing your team to transfer this knowledge to which ever language
        you choose. But only OSHIP provides you with the complete bottom to
        top access to a solution to your healthcare application
        interoperability requirements. You can then take this knowledge and
        transfer it to your preferred development environment. </p>

<p><b>After adding your 'oship' (case sensitive, no quotes) application. Then
return here by clicking on the <b>'oship' link in the top left</b> and
execute this <a href="http://localhost:8080/oship/setup">setup link.</a></b>
When your ADL files are finished processing; you will be redirected to the
Zope Management Interface (ZMI).<br>
Just click down through the menu on the top left to find the 'ar'. </p>

<p>The links below will provide you with a start into the world of
interoperable healthcare applications. </p>

<p><span style="font-size: smaller;">Please note that the API links run on
your local server and we assume that you are in development mode on the same
machine as the server. If your URL to the server is different than
http://localhost:8080 then you will need to adjust the links. </span></p>
