Create Future Proof Healthcare Applications!
These installation instructions only apply to Linux.  If you can then please contribute a section on Microsoft Windows versions installation.
If you do not have Python2.4 on your system then install Python 2.4.x http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.4.5/&nbsp;
You will need setuptools for Python2.4 as well.  Get the ez_setup.py script from PEAK http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#installing-easy-install&nbsp;
In order to isolate your OSHIP development environment from your system Python, you should use virtualenv http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv/1.1&nbsp; to create your Python24 development environment.
In the following instructions the $ represents the tail of your system prompt.
Once you have installed easy_install from PEAK;
$easy_install virtualenv
Create your sandbox directory.
$mkdir sandbox
Setup the virtualenv
$virtualenv sandbox
$cd sandbox
$source bin/activate
Now your system prompt should be preceded with (sandbox)  e.g.  (sandbox) [tim@oship sandbox]$
Create a directory in your home directory called  .buildout (note the leading dot).  Inside that directory create a file called default.cfg.  In this file you will enter the location where you want to store all of the Python eggs that will be downloaded.  For example mine is:
[buildout]
eggs-directory=/home/tim/buildout-eggs
$cd oship
Checkout the source from svn:
svn co http://www.openehr.org/svn/ref_impl_python/TRUNK/oship/
$buildout
This is coffee break time.  All of the required Python eggs will be downloaded and installed.  You might consider reading the OSHIPUsage.pdf document now as well as the references included there.
NOTE: I've seen some errors during these downloads such as unknown protocols for svn and https but everything seems to work okay and I haven't investigated the cause yet.
...
Now you have a working OSHIP installation. 
You can start the server with
$bin/oship-ctl fg
Verify it is up by visiting http://localhost:8080 in your browser.
The login link is on the upper right side of the browser window.

Now read OSHIPUsage.pdf
