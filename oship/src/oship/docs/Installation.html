        <h2>Installing the OSHIP framework on GNU Linux</h2>
        <p>
        In the following lines with instructions (in pink), the leading <b>$</b> represents the tail of your
        system prompt. It may be necessary to prefix the commands with 'sudo' when you, using a non-administrator account,
        try to install into system-wide Python directories.
        </p>

        <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
        <dl>
                <dt>Python2.5</dt>
                <dd>OSHIP requires at least Python 2.5; if it is not already installed
                on your system, you can download it from <a href="http://www.python.org/">http://www.python.org</a>.
                We also need Python header files. They can be obtained by something like:
                <pre>
$sudo apt-get install python-dev</pre>
                </dd>
                <dt>g++</dt>
                <dd>In order to create Python C extensions a compiler is needed. On Ubuntu, this means installing
                the package build-essential:
                <pre>
$sudo apt-get install build-essential</pre>
                </dd>
                <dt>setuptools</dt>
                <dd>This package contains the easy_setup command, to make installing the next item real easy.
                <pre>
$wget http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py
$sudo python ez_setup.py</pre>
                </dd>
                <dt>virtualenv</dt>
                <dd>In order to prevent your OSHIP project interfering with your other never-ending projects,
                we advice you to work in separate environments. Virtualenv can be used to create isolated
                environments.<br>
                <pre>
$sudo easy_install virtualenv</pre>
                </dd>
                <dt>subversion</dt>
                <dd>We currently use subversion (svn) as a version control system in our project. You can probably
                install it by means of something like
                <pre>
$sudo apt-get install subversion</pre>
                </dd>
        </dl>

        <h3>Installation steps (tested on Ubuntu 8.04 and 8.10, both with Grok 0.14)</h3>
        <ol>
                <li>Let's prepare for the use of buildout; we use it now, and in the future. Buildout makes the process of 
                creating projects repeatable. For example, it can pinpoint the versions of the software
                components used in the project. In order to be able to repeat the building of a specific project 
                in the distant future, it is vital to have a local copy of the used components. We tuck them away
                in the hidden directory <b>.buildout</b> (note the leading dot):
                <pre>
$mkdir ~/.buildout
$cd ~/.buildout</pre>
                Now use your favorite text editor to create the file <b>default.cfg</b> containing the following:
                <pre>
[buildout]
eggs-directory = /home/&lt;username&gt;/.buildout/eggs
download-directory = /home/&lt;username&gt;/.buildout/downloads</pre>
                Of course, you have to substitute &lt;username &gt; with your own username.
                </li>
                <li>
                Now create the isolated OSHIP environment and activate it:
                <pre>
$virtualenv ~/oshipenv
$cd ~/oshipenv
$source bin/activate</pre>
                Check that your system prompt is now prefixed with <b>(oshipenv)</b>
                e.g.<pre>
(oshipenv)&lt;username&gt;@&lt;machinename&gt;:~/oshipenv$</pre>
                </li>
                <li>Then, install the buildout-machinery.
                <pre>
$easy_install zc.buildout</pre>
                </li>
                <li>We provide you with a buildout recipe in the file <b>buildout.cfg</b>. Get it, and our other source
                files, from <a href="http://www.openehr.org/svn/ref_impl_python/TRUNK/oship">our subversion server</a>:
                <pre>
svn co http://www.openehr.org/svn/ref_impl_python/TRUNK/oship oship</pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                Now it's time for a chat at the coffee machine. Meanwhile, let buildout create your project:
                <pre>
$cd oship
$buildout</pre>
                All of the required Python eggs will be downloaded and installed.<br>
                <em>NOTE: In the past, we saw some errors during these downloads such as unknown
                protocols for svn and https but everything seemed to work okay and we
                haven't investigated the cause yet.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                Finally, you have a working OSHIP installation. You can start the server with
                <pre>
$bin/zopectl fg</pre> 
<p>Note that you need to enter this command from the oship directory.<br>
Verify that the server is up and running by visiting <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080</a> in your browser.<br>
The login link is on the upper right side of the browser window. <em>login=admin password=abc123</em>. Your browser may look something
like this:</p>

<p>Now enter "oship" (without the quotes) into the form to create the OSHIP application.  Then change your URL to <a href="http://localhost:8080/oship">http://localhost:8080/oship</a></p>
Now you should have a browser that looks like this:<br>

        <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
        <dl>
                <dt>Python2.5 (tested with version 2.5.2)</dt>
                <dd>OSHIP requires at least Python 2.5; if it is not already installed
                on your system, you can download an installer from <a href="http://python.org/download/releases/2.5.2">http://www.python.org</a>.
                We assume it is installed for all users in the default directory C:\python25. You don't need to specify
                the full path of the Python binary every time you need it. Just add the directories <b>C:\Python25</b>
                and <b>C:\Python25\Scripts</b> to your environment variable <b>%PATH%</b>. See the instructions to do so at:  
                <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml">How do I set or change the PATH system variable</a>
                </dd>
                <dt>win32all (tested with build 212)</dt>
                <dd>The <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=78018">win32all</a> package adds a 
                number of Windows-specific extensions to Python.
                </dd>
                <dt>setuptools (tested with version 0.6c9)</dt>
                <dd>This package contains the easy_setup command, to make installing the next item real easy.
                <ol>
                        <li>Download the executable <a href="http://pypi.python.org/packages/2.5/s/setuptools">
                                from the Python Package Index</a></li>
                        <li>After installing, verify that C:\Python25\Scripts now contains the file <b>easy_install.exe</b>.</li>
                </ol>
                </dd>
                <dt>virtualenv (tested with version 1.2dev)</dt>

                </ol>
                </dd>
                <dt>A subversion client (tested with pysvn 1.6.2 and WorkBench 1.5.6 supporting Subversion 1.5.3)</dt>
                <dd>We currently use subversion (svn) as a version control system in our project. Since we love Python, we suggest using 
                <a href="http://pysvn.tigris.org/">pysvn and its WorkBench GUI</a> as svn client software.

        <h3>Installation steps (tested with Grok 0.14)</h3>
        <ol>
                <li>
                First, open a cmd window, create the isolated OSHIP environment, and activate it. We assume that we start in the
                root folder C:\
                <pre>
virtualenv oshipenv
cd oshipenv
Scripts\activate.bat</pre>
                Check that your system prompt is now prefixed with <b>(oshipenv)&nbsp;</b>
                e.g.<pre>
(oshipenv)&nbsp;C:\oshipenv></pre>
                </li>
                <li>Then, install the buildout-machinery.
                <pre>
easy_install zc.buildout</pre>
                </li>
                <li>We provide you with a buildout recipe in the file <b>buildout.cfg</b>. We store this, and other 
                files, on <a href="http://www.openehr.org/svn/ref_impl_python/TRUNK/oship">our subversion server</a>. Use the svn
                checkout command to obtain your own working copy in the to be created subfolder <b>oship</b>.
                <pre>
svn co http://www.openehr.org/svn/ref_impl_python/TRUNK/oship</pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                Now it's time for a chat at the coffee machine. Meanwhile, let buildout create your project:
                <pre>
cd oship
buildout</pre>
                All of the required Python eggs will be downloaded and installed.<br>
                <tt>Alas, the process fails currently. We need to take refuge to this work-around:</tt>
                <blockquote>
After the error occurs (I assume here it is tyring to install zope.app.testing with version 3.4.3), type the command
<pre>
easy_install zope.app.testing==3.4.3</pre>

and wait. This will run until the following error occurs (when trying to 
install zope.app.container):<br />
error: Setup script exited with error: Python was built with Visual Studio version 7.1,
and extensions need to be built with the same version of the compiler, but it isn't installed.<br /><br />

Duh. Let's continue with the buildout:
<pre>
buildout</pre>

Buildout will now halt at package zope.app.file, so jump again through 
the hoop:
<pre>
easy_install zope.app.file==3.4.4</pre>

where, again, the version number 3.4.4 is taken from the error message. Wait some more for the Visual Studio error to
reoccur, and invoke buildout one more time:
<pre>
buildout</pre>

This time it will finish gracefully.
                </blockquote>
                </li>
                <li>
                Finally, you have a working OSHIP installation. You can start the server with
                <pre>
bin/zopectl fg</pre>
Verify it is up by visiting <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080</a> in your browser.
The login link is on the upper right side of the browser window. <em>login=admin password=abc123</em>
                </li>
        </ol>
<p>Once the server is running you will need to add the application 'oship' in the form provided.  
Then change your URL to http://localhost:8080/oship.</p>
<p>
Now you should have a browser that looks pretty much like this.<br>

<img src="OSHIP_framework_contents.png" alt="Oship index page"></p>
<p>
There are links on this page to the relevant APIs as well as 
background information you need to build health care applications with OSHIP.
