        <h2>Installing the OSHIP framework on GNU Linux</h2>
        <p>
        In the following lines with instructions (in pink), the leading <b>$</b> represents the tail of your
        system prompt. It may be necessary to prefix the commands with 'sudo' when you, using a non-administrator account,
        try to install into system-wide Python directories.
        </p>

        <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
        <dl>
                <dt>Python2.5</dt>
                <dd>OSHIP requires at least Python 2.5; if it is not already installed
                on your system, you can download it from <a href="http://www.python.org/">http://www.python.org</a>.
                We also need Python header files. They can be obtained by something like:
                <pre>
$sudo apt-get install python-dev</pre>
                </dd>
                <dt>g++</dt>
                <dd>In order to create Python C extensions a compiler is needed. On Ubuntu, this means installing
                the package build-essential:
                <pre>
$sudo apt-get install build-essential</pre>
                </dd>
                <dt>setuptools</dt>
                <dd>This package contains the easy_setup command, to make installing the next item real easy.
                <pre>
$wget http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py
$sudo python ez_setup.py</pre>
                </dd>
                <dt>virtualenv</dt>
                <dd>In order to prevent your OSHIP project interfering with your other never-ending projects,
                we advice you to work in separate environments. Virtualenv can be used to create isolated
                environments.<br>
                <pre>
$sudo easy_install virtualenv</pre>
                </dd>
                <dt>bazaar</dt>
                <dd>We currently use bazaar (bzr) as a version control system in our project. You can probably
                install it by means of something like
                <pre>
$sudo apt-get install bzr</pre>
                </dd>
        </dl>

        <h3>Installation steps (tested on Ubuntu 8.04 and 8.10)</h3>
        <ol>
                <li>Let's prepare for the use of buildout; we use it now, and in the future. Buildout makes the process of 
                creating projects repeatable. For example, it can pinpoint the versions of the software
                components used in the project. In order to be able to repeat the building of a specific project 
                in the distant future, it is vital to have a local copy of the used components. We tuck them away
                in the hidden directory <b>.buildout</b> (note the leading dot):
                <pre>
$mkdir ~/.buildout
$cd ~/.buildout</pre>
                Now use your favorite text editor to create the file <b>default.cfg</b> containing the following:
                <pre>
[buildout]
eggs-directory = /home/&lt;username&gt;/.buildout/eggs
download-directory = /home/&lt;username&gt;/.buildout/downloads</pre>
                Of course, you have to substitute &lt;username &gt; with your own username.
                </li>
                <li>
                Now create the isolated OSHIP environment and activate it:
                <pre>
$virtualenv ~/oshipenv
$cd ~/oshipenv
$source bin/activate</pre>
                Check that your system prompt is now prefixed with <b>(oshipenv)</b>
                e.g.<pre>
(oshipenv)&lt;username&gt;@&lt;machinename&gt;:~/oshipenv$</pre>
                </li>
                <pre>
$cd oship/oship
$python bootstrap.py
$bin/buildout</pre>
                Required directories and files will be created as well as all of the required Python eggs will be downloaded and installed.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                Finally, you have a working OSHIP installation. You can start the server with
                <pre>
$bin/oship-ctl fg</pre> 
<p>Note that you need to enter this command from the oship directory.<br>
Verify that the server is up and running by visiting <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080</a> in your browser.<br>
The HTTP login box will appear. <em>login=admin password=admin</em>. Your browser should look something
like this:</p>
<img src="AddApplication.png" alt="Add Applications">
<p>Now enter "oship" (without the quotes) into the oship.app.oship input box to create the OSHIP application. </p> 
<img src="oship_added.png" alt="OSHIP Added">
<p>
Then click the link that says "oship (oship)"  under the Installed applications header.</p>
Now you should have a browser that looks like this:<br>

<img src="oship_main.png" alt="OSHIP Main Page">
                </li>
        </ol>
        
<p>
Click on the setup link in step one.  Then you may go on to explore the other pages.<br />
If you install any of the terminologies then take a look at your terminnal window for feedback on what was loaded.   
</p>
<p>Next, take a browse through some of  the API and ZODB links to learn a lot more about the ZCA, Grok and OSHIP.</p>
<p>You can add the Blood Pressure registry demo by going back to the add applications page at <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080</a> </p>
