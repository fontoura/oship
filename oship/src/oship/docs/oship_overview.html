<H1 CLASS="western">Mission:</H1>
<P>To be the place where healthcare information crosses borders.</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">Vision:</H1>
<P>To address the need to facilitate healthcare information exchange
between the major healthcare information models; HL7, CEN/ISO13606
and openEHR as well as the many proprietary models established by
governments, companies, open source projects and NGOs.</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">Background:</H1>
<P>The Open Source Health Information Platform (OSHIP) has been
concentrated on the production of a Python language implementation of
the openEHR Information Model specifications. These specifications
are the most robust and most open specifications available. 
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>To be pragmatic though we must realize that the world of health
informatics is a varied and competitive area.  Authors of every model
are welcome and encouraged to contribute to OSHIP.  Whether you want
to develop a healthcare information application based on a specific
model or you want to create a utility to transform information
between models; OSHIP is a place where you can accomplish those
tasks.  
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>OSHIP is designed to reduce the friction between models by
providing a place where application developers of every model
(including proprietary ones) can enjoy the benefits of information
exchange in an information model centric, object oriented
environment.  
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">Scenarios:</H1>
<P>For more than 40 years the health informatics world has struggled
with the core issue of semantic information exchange.  It is becoming
more and more obvious that this exchange must be outside of any “data
model” and must really exist at the “information model” level. 
OSHIP is the platform that can address this issue without using the
tedious messaging paradigm that is so laborious.</P>
<P>Let's say that OpenMRS, OpenEMR, VistA or Cerner wants to be able
to exchange healthcare information with other applications via HL7v3
(CCR?) or openEHR.  They could create internal interfaces and
application utilities to do this. This will mean that they must
maintain both sides of the models over time in order to be
successful.  With OSHIP, every organization only has to maintain
their own model, whether they chose to be open source or proprietary,
it doesn't matter.  They can create their information model in OSHIP
and then develop a utility that does the transformation using the
OSHIP open source platform.   If Cerner wants to talk to GE and keep
their models secret, then they will have to work together and share
those.  Of course the focus of OSHIP is for open source and open
information models.  Open source applications can share their models
via OSHIP and allow others to inter-operate with them at will.  We
believe that the more we share the better off the entire field of
health informatics becomes.  
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">Facilities:</H1>
<P>OSHIP is not some grand invention within itself.  OSHIP builds
upon the ideals of open source and sharing.   We heavily leverage the
success and validation of thousands of applications, individual
developers and companies from across the globe.   Healthcare
information is complex by its very nature.   Healthcare information
system developers need to recognize this fact at the outset.  By
combining many different components and using an easy to learn
programming language, OSHIP provides the glue between models for your
application to share information.   
</P>
<P>Healthcare information systems manage content.  Therefore they are
Content Management System (CMS) applications;  even though the
information has many complex temporal and spatial components. 
Therefore we have chosen a framework that was designed to manage
complex content.  The Zope Component Architecture (ZCA) has the
builtin facilities to accomplish any task that you require.  By
layering on the Grok development environment, OSHIP now provides an
easy entry into the sometimes obscure and complex world of the ZCA.  
This combination gives OSHIP users and developers an easy entry into
healthcare information management  that is also very powerful and
capable of handling any task.
