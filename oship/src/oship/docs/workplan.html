<P>This page describes the work plan for OSHIP developers. 
</P>
<P>The idea is to provide a process that allows full collaboration
among several developers but does not impose undue constraints (time
and talents) on who can and cannot contribute to the development and
promotion of OSHIP.</P>
<P>A project of this size requires a large number of contributors
with a wide variety of expertise.   The broader openEHR community
provides a lot of that expertise and we can and do leverage it quite
well.  We also re-use the Python and Zope community contributions. 
This <B>is</B> the wonderful result of open source and open
collaboration towards a common cause. 
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The most urgent need for OSHIP is to complete the implementation
of all the classes in the openEHR reference model and archetype
model.  
</P>
<P>The interfaces are complete.  Interfaces basically describe the
attributes and  methods of each class in the models.  The
implementations of those classes are at varying levels of completion.
 The document <A HREF="class_status.html">class_status.html</A> 
shows the status, the filename and the classname (incomplete as yet)
of each class in the model.  The status column indicators are as
follows:</P>
<P>√ == complete and checked by multiple developers</P>
<P>⧫ <FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">== currently being
implemented by an OSHIP developer</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">(blank) == awaiting someone to
take it on</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">Anyone can select any class
that they wish to work on implementing.  You do not have to be an
expert on openEHR or even a Python/Zope guru.  This is an open source
project and a great opportunity for all of us to learn and
contribute.   The approach that I am outlining follows what we did at
the LNCC workshop and I think we were very successful.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">Select a filename/classname
from the class_status.html page that you would like to work on.  Send
me a private email or send one to the mailing list saying that you
are taking it on.  I will update the  class_status.html with a </FONT><FONT FACE="DejaVu LGC Serif, serif">⧫
in the status column so no one else chooses it.   When it is complete
and committed I will put a √ in the status column.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="DejaVu LGC Serif, serif">These tasks are generally
quite simple and I will personally tutor you or </FONT><FONT FACE="DejaVu LGC Serif, serif"><B>(preferably)</B></FONT><FONT FACE="DejaVu LGC Serif, serif">
you will communicate with the community via the mailing list.   Think
of it as an opportunity to attend the international openEHR
University and Python programming course.   :-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="DejaVu LGC Serif, serif">Once you select a class to
implement you will find that it is already partially implemented or
that it is simply a copy of the class interface.  You will then need
to complete the implementation as described below.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="DejaVu LGC Serif, serif">Interfaces are definitions of
a class (of sorts) that say what that class defines as attributes and
methods.  They are sort of a contract to the rest of the application
saying that they will provide those entities.  Python doesn't have a
formal interface capability but we use the Zope Component
Architecture's (ZCA) interface implementation to create this facility
within OSHIP.    The OSHIP interfaces were defined precisely from the
openEHR specifications, Release 1.0.1.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="DejaVu LGC Serif, serif">When you select a class to
work on you will see that it has a corresponding interface in the
'interfaces' subdirectory.  Your task is to be sure that the class
implements the attributes defined in the interface as well as all
inherited attributes in its __init___().  The class must also provide
the functionality described for each method detailed in the
interface.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="DejaVu LGC Serif, serif">There are doc strings for
each of these but you should also refer to the referenced openEHR
documentation and implement according to those specifications.  If
you have a question, comment or problem please discuss it on the
mailing list.  A foundational pillar of openEHR is implementation. 
We can change the specs if it is not implementable in an OO language.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="DejaVu LGC Serif, serif">Some may ask, why we need
these interfaces.  We can just build the classes in Python and be
done.  That is very true; we could.  However, I wanted OSHIP to be
more functional than just a reference implementation.   In the time I
spent building the interfaces I could have probably been finished
with a pure Python implementation.   But, we are increasingly seeing
the reality that more people that are new to openEHR want something
that they can turn on and run.  This is what users and even
developers are used to having.   This is why I decided to build the
Python implementation in concert with the Zope Component
Architecture.  While there is very little dependence on the ZCA; the
interfaces are a major dependence.   The interfaces provide the ZCA
infrastructure with the meta-data that it needs to automatically
create webpages, etc.   Though we have work to do in creating custom
widgets for our classes.  The overall effect will be that others can
create small, purpose specific healthcare applications that can
easily exchange semantically correct information with other
applications, large or small.  This is actually a very long
discussion so I'll close it by saying that a little bit of extra work
here and now will save an enormous amount later AND more importantly
it will attract more healthcare information specialists to the world
of two-level modeling.</FONT></P>

skills or your Python skills.  Pick a file to work on and let's get
started!!!!</FONT></P>
