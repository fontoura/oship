The Open Source Health Information Platform (OSHIP) is the Python language implementation of the openEHR healthcare information model. 
<p>
 OSHIP expands upon the model by providing you with a robust, proven, standards compliant and open source application server and development environment. The openEHR model provides you with the structure to create future proof
 and semantically interoperable healthcare applications.  Everything from disease registries to complete electronic health record systems.<br />
 OSHIP adds on the layer that you need to rapidly become familiar with the openEHR model and begin building your applications today.  There are
 implementations in most popular object oriented languages allowing your team to transfer this knowledge to which ever language you choose.  But only OSHIP provides you with the complete bottom to top access to a 
 solution to your healthcare application interoperability requirements.  You can then take this knowledge and transfer it to your preferred 
development environment.

<b>The first thing to do is to go to the <a href="http://localhost:8080/applications">Add Application form</a> and create your 
'Oship' (case sensitive, no quotes) application. Then return here by clicking on the <b>Oship (Oship) link</b> and execute this 
<a href="http://localhost:8080/Oship/setup">setup link.</a></b>
You should then return to the main page.

<p>
The links below will provide you with a start into the world of interoperable healthcare applications. 

<p> <span style="font-size: smaller;">
Please note that the API links run on your local server and we assume that you are in development mode on the same machine as the server.  
If your URL to the server is different than http://localhost:8080 then you will need to adjust the links.

OSHIP is open source software based on an open specification.  Both the specifications and the software are licensed under a business friendly
license allowing for both open source and proprietary applications to be developed and still share semantically complete information.
